    <ul>
    <li>Start with your paper white side up or the color that you don't want to see,<br> in this case, the bunny will be yellow.</li>

    <li>Fold the top corner down to the bottom and make a precise crease.</li>

    <li>Fold both the top left and top right corners down to the bottom point and crease well.</li>
    
    <li>Fold the left and right corners up to the top point, again creasing well.</li>
    
    <li>Start with the right flap, open it out to the right, <br>pressing the top of it down to form a slanted triangle.</li>
    
    <li>Repeat on the left side.</li>
    
    <li>traditional origami rabbit diagram</li>
    
    <li>Make the Ears and Nose</li>
    
    <li>Rotate the paper to the left a little.</li>
    
    <li>Fold the top section backward and behind.</li>
    
    <li>Take the flap, which is at the bottom right, and flip it up and behind.<br> This is a rotation movement, not a reverse fold.</li>
    
    <li>Repeat on the flap on the back.</li>
    
    <li>Fold the ears over to the left as indicated,<br> the ears don't have to all be the same, as it's an animal, it looks nicer with some asymmetrical folds.</li>
    
    <li>Hold onto the ears at the head.</li>
    
    <li>Open out the left sections.</li>
    
    <li>The nose should go downward,<br> while the left flaps are pushed over the top of the ears on both the front and back of the rabbit.</li>

    <li>Finish up</li>
    
    <li>Make the two folds indicted and pleat fold them.</li>
    
    <li>the fold on the left is a mountain fold, while the diagonal fold is a valley fold.</li> 
    
    <li>Open out the back of the rabbit to pleat fold them inside.</li>
   
    <li>Fold the nose under.</li>
    
    <li>This is now complete, but we like to fold the ears back out a little.</li>
      
    <li>We also like to glue the flaps that stick out from the neck, depending on what type of paper you use.</li>

<p><i><ul>
  <li>Starting white side up, fold your paper diagonally in half and then in half again.<br> Start with your paper in the position shown.
  <li> Fold the bottom left of the top layer up to the top right corner.</li>
<li> Repeat on the back.</li>

<li>Position Your Paper and Fold Again</li>

<li>Folds for the body of the origami peace dove</li>

<li>Make sure the paper is in this position.</li>
  
<li> Fold one layer from the bottom corner up to the top.</li>

<li>Unfold and reverse inside fold the last crease.</li>

<li> Flatten the model again.</li>
    
  <li> Making the beak of the origami peace dove</li>

  <li> Repeat the last fold on the back. This is the view from the top.</li>

  <li>Fold the head of the dove down like this.</li>

  <li> Inside reverse fold the head.</li>

  <li>Pull the beak until it's in the position you want.</li>

  <li>This is what it should look like.</li>
